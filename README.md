# FFXIV Consumable Market Analysis - Final-Project-CAPSTONE

## Project/Goals

In this project I'll be exploring the In-Game market of Final Fantasy XIV. Specifically My plan is to use this collected data to determine what day of the week the consumable market is most stable so that I can list my own items in that price range and maximize my profits on the unstable days.

## Process

### Data Collection / API research

The 1st step in this project was to find some public APIs to get the market board data. To do this I searched through some player/community run websites that have some market tracking capabilities  and found that the Universalis project has an API available for people to send requests to to retrieve live and historical market data for specific items (<https://docs.universalis.app/>). Very conveniently the Universalis API Doc points to some other APIs to map item IDs to their item names. The API I'll be using to map these items will be XIVAPI (<https://xivapi.com/docs>) since this one api has another endpoint I can use to map world IDs from the market API to their appropriate names.

- universalis = market data per itemID per worldID
- XIVAPI = Item and World names by ID
